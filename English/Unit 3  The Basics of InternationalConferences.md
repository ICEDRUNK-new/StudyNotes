*In conclusion, attending conferences allows you to present your latest findings, join discussions, and network with peers, which is likely to enrich your research and career and facilitate continuous learning.* 



#### How to Find Academic Conferences  

##### · Internet search engines

All major search engines employ their own methods/ algorithms，you are recommended to use multiple search engines to avoid leaving out highly relevant results.

##### · Conference alert platforms

Subscribing to personalized conference alerts to keep track of newly-announced events.  

##### · Journals and magazines

##### · Consulting your supervisors and fellow researchers

Ask your supervisors and fellow researchers what local, national, and international conferences they've attended and how beneficial they consider those events. 

*Finally, when looking for a conference to attend, you need to learn to identify and avoid predatory conferences.   These “ predatory conferences” are not organized by scholarly or professional societies and do not use a peer-review system. They often have high acceptance rates and charge excessive fees to attend. Predatory conferences usually falsely claim that certain researchers sit on their organizing committees. Attending a predatory conference can be a costly mistake for your research and budget.*



#### The Formats of Conference Sessions

Conference session formats may vary depending on the size and scope of the conference and whether it is held online or offline. Even though conference session formats take various names, they can be roughly classified into keynote sessions, oral sessions, poster sessions, and research-in-progress sessions (excluding opening and closing ceremonies).

##### · Keynote sessions

A keynote session consists of one or multiple invited lectures or keynote presentations by well-known experts in a research field. Keynote speeches serve the function of setting the tone for the theme of the conference and are of universal significance and general interests for all the participants.

##### · Oral sessions

Oral session, sometimes called paper session. In general, abstracts or full-length papers that have gone through peer review and received relatively high scores would be presented orally, while those that have passed peer review with relatively low scores would be presented as posters.Oral sessions can be further divided intoindividual paper sessions and colloquium/ colloquia sessions depending on whether the papers in a session have been accepted independently from each other or accepted simultaneously under the umbrella of a pre-selected topic.  Papers presented at oral sessions form the main part of conference preprints or proceedings.

##### · Poster sessions

Papers presented in poster sessions are displayed as posters posted on boards or walls in a specially separated area of a conference venue. Conference participants can go there, read the posters, and have a brief discussion with the authors. Sometimes contributions submitted as an oral presentation may be accepted as a poster due to the limited amount of time
slots available for oral presentation.Poster sessions allow  longer and more in-depth discussions than oral sessions.

##### · Research-in-progress sessions

A place to discuss new research, projects, or current work in progress in a comfortable and enriching learning environment. 

##### · Symposia

Symposia consist of a small group of presenters who share differing ideas related to a common theme and discuss them with the audience. Note that a symposium often consists of scholarly research conducted independently by the different presenters, whereas a panel discussion frequently is a forum for research or expertise thatpanelists have gained over time. Unlike other concurrent sessions, which are organized by conference organizers or section chairs, symposia/ panels are organized by the presenters.
