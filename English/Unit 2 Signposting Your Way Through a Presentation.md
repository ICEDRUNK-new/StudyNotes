#### Signposting Language

Using signposting language is an effective way to make your presentation easy to follow. Signposting language in a presentation is verbal statements—usually words,phrases or sentences—that clearly highlight your key points and signal the logical connections between your ideas. Signposting language is much more than just listing the order of ideas. It is more about telling the audience what you have done, what you are doing, and what you will do.

#### Why Do We Need Signposting Language in a Presentation?

envision 设想；想象；展望    tune out 设想；想象；展望

To summarize, signposting language is really important as it makes the organization of your presentation clearer to the audience and really helps the audience process the ideas that you are trying to pass across to them.

#### Types of Presentation Signposts

elaboration 阐述；详细说明            tangent 切线；正切；相切的；切线的；离题的         crucial 至关重要的

genetically modified(GM) food 转基因食品   go off 离开；爆炸；突然响起；进行           commentary 评论，评价

When you are about to take up the next point after concluding one point, the audience must know you are moving to a new point,just like what a tour guide says “time to move on” to the visitors when they are through a particular area and want to visit a new place. 

When you need to go into details on a point, you give the audience the signal of expansion or elaboration which will enable them to know there is more information coming on a particular topic, and that the speaker is still on the same topic but will be discussing it in more details. Also, it's often proper to go off on a tangent for a moment to express another crucial point that is loosely related to the main topic. 

Summarizing a speech gives the audience a better understanding of what you have conveyed to them in a nutshell.
