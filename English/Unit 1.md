### Unit 1

Three ingredients of presentation: content, design and delivery. It's crucial to understand that you can't expect a successful presentation unless each of these carries equal weight and importance. 

#### Content—Structuring Your Presentation  

Content should be well-researched, genuine, precise, and contextual. To achieve them, you have to answer these following questions:

1. What's your objective of the presentation? to report, to argue, to compare, to convince, to question?
2. What is the central idea of the presentation?
3. What are the main arguments or ideas? Are they supported with relevant evidence?
4. How shall I demonstrate my knowledge of the subject?
5. Is the level of technicality suited to the audience?
6. What questions are likely to be prompted by my presentation? How do I reply to audience's question?

Then you must outline clearly basing on answers before, so that your audiences can follow topic easily. Most presentations are organized  with three parts: introduction, main part and closing. There is a normal format image below.

Depending on the time limit, you need to be selective in the body where you may wish to cover only the most relevant and interesting points in a logical and coherent order, such as chronological, topical, cause and effect, comparison and contract, or problem-solution orders. It is also important to state the links between your ideas clearly with transitional devices to help the audience follow the direction of your talk: firstly...;secondly...; another important point is...; on the other hand, ...; I would now
like to move on to another aspect of the research ...

#### Design—Using Visuals to Your Advantage  

1.PowerPoint slides are not the platform for a manuscript.

2.Make PowerPoint slides readable and understandable.  Use one slide for each idea or point. Use bullets to highlight individual points. Use large fonts .Use only one font style throughout the presentation.  Follow “The Rule of Seven”. Limit text on a slide to no more than 7 words per line, and no more than 7 lines per slide. Use the same colour scheme throughout the presentation for titles, text,and background.

#### Delivery—Leveraging Your Body Language

Communication, on a face-to-face basis, is thought to consist of three separate elements: Words; Tone of voice; Body language. All three elements can be conveyed at the same time to express an overall message. Often, the tone of voice and body language are combined to become the most powerful mode of communication. 

Make eye contact.  Any time you are communicating information, you should be looking at an audience member.   

Pay attention to facial expressions.   Correct body posture.   Speak with your hands.   Consider your clothes.
